# AGA Nash App

This app was developed for the American Gastroenterological Association in order to help general practitioners
to determine the risk level of their patients for Non-Alcholic Fatty Liver Disease (NASH).

## Installation

Use the package manager [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to install aga-nash-app.

```bash
yarn install
```

In order to run the app, you'll need Expo cli installed [expo](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/expo-cli/)

```bash
yarn install expo-cli
```

## Usage

When you run the app locally ( on Mac ), you can simply run:

```bash
expo start
```

This will start a local server where you can then start up an ios simulator to run the app.

If you would like to run it on Android, then using the same server, you can run an Android emulator using Android Studio. I've found this rather difficult however, and would recommend simply using the QR code that shows up on the local server that expo go has to then use the expo go app on your android device and run the app on your android device.
